## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Receive an error message when the contact form is submitted if:
  - The `Name`, `Email Address` or `Your Message` fields are empty should show "Can't be empty"
  - The `Email Address` is not formatted correctly should show "Please use a valid email address"
- **Bonus**: View actual locations on the locations page maps (we recommend [Leaflet JS](https://leafletjs.com/) for this)

### What I learned

üöÄ While working on the project, I used React's Next.js framework. I thought utilizing Next.js components like Image üñºÔ∏è and Link üîó would enhance the site's accessibility and performance. I grouped common components under individual ones as much as possible. This helped me avoid code repetition and increased sustainability. For maps, I used Leaflet üó∫Ô∏è and aimed to adhere to the project's design as much as I could.

Throughout the process, I've learned numerous things. I realized the significance of taking a holistic approach when designing a website and solving encountered errors in an analytical manner. This project has been a valuable learning experience for me. üåü
